###### Code Your Solutions Here!!!

#Your code should work with a hash that looks like the one below (in comments).
#The specs (which call your tests) are using these exact hashes
# We haven't hard coded the hashes in the tests, 
#they're dynamically brought in from the NYC Open Data API

first_recycle_bin =  {
   "address"=>"E 227 St/Bronx River Pkway",
   "site_type"=>"Subproperty",
   "longitude"=>"-73.864223918",
   "borough"=>"Bronx",
   "latitude"=>"40.890848989",
   "park_site_name"=>"227th St. Plgd"
 }


#1. Define a method `address`, that takes a hash as an argument.
#This method should return the value of the address key in the hash.
def address(a_hash)
  return a_hash("address")
end

#2. Define a method called `borough` that takes a hash as an argument.
# This method should return the value of the borough key in the hash.
def borough(a_hash)
  return a_hash("borough")
end

#3. Define a method called `all_keys` that takes a hash as an argument.
#This method should print out each key in the hash. 
#You should use the `each_key` method to iterate over your hash and print out each key.
def all_keys(a_hash)
  puts a_hash.each_key
end

#4. Define a method called `all_data` that takes a hash as an argument.
#This method should print out each value in the hash.
#You should use the `each_value` method to iterate over your hash and print out each value.
def all_data(a_hash)
  puts a_hash.each_value
end


#5. Define a method called `key_and_data` that takes a hash as an argument.
#This method should print out each key and value in the hash in a sentence like this: `The #{key} is #{value}`
#You should use the `each` method to iterate over your hash to print out that sentence
def key_and_data(a_hash)
  a_hash.each do |key, value|
    puts "The #{key} is #{value}"
  end
end
